# Auto-PlayPause-Video-Face-Recognition

This Python code wrote just by fun and learning

Have you tired of playing and pausing videos againg and again when you getting up and sitting down.
Now there is a solution! Just run this code and enjoy your video. Also you can even let this work just with your face.

If the camera see a face then your video just keeping up normally, when you getting up from chair then camera won't see your face and it will pause the video for you, when you sitting down again it will keep playing automatically.

For the best experience; when you run the code, your video should be paused.
